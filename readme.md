# Technical test for Data Analyst Intern at Proprioo 🏡 - By Vincent DEBANDE 

Hello ! this is my technical test for the internship application at Proprioo 🏡🏠

## Some things about me

Well, first of all, you might want to know who I am, right ? 

My name is Vincent. I'm a last year student in Engeneering specialized in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 📊💻 at ESILV. 

## Why Data Science ? 📊

I love to learn things, discorver new fields and understand new subjects. The idea to apply my skills in **ANY** fields is something really exciting. 

Data Science is about finding meaning into the data. By looking into it, you might be able to find patterns, to find information and knowledge. Using this knowledge, you can make informed decision that affects your business. 

That's why I specialized in Data Science and AI : I love to dicover new fields and I have an analytical mind !

## I am realy proud about this ⬇⬇

**LeoLearning** : this is the name of the Association I co-created with 2 of my friends 3 years ago. At the beginning of my studies, I faced some challenges. My friends looked for else from older students and the results were always the same : "Yes, I can help you. But you'll have to pay me 🤑". 

Not nice. 

So, we came up with our solution : the mentoring association of the Pole Leonard Da Vinci. Older student help younger ones through **free** courses all year. 

Today, we are a team of 60. I managed day-to-day a 6 members team. Our mission is to make all the courses process work (from signup to the course).

I learned so much about team working and team management!

# Enough about me, let's see the test 🎉

## Mission 

A property has a price and other attributes. A client has needs. The goal is to find potential buyers for a given property 🎯

## My ideas 

My first thoughts were : "This is a recommandation system" and "I need to determine how far a property is from my customer's needs". 

Based on this ideas, I first wanted to get to know my data a little bit better. I did some basics analysis on a **Jupyter Notebook**. 

Then, I wanted to generate some property because after a first look, I saw that my customers did not match the property. 

Fianlly, I had to create the script. I had 3 possible solutions (a lot more actually, but these were the first coming to my mind) :

- IF - THEN script : not really elegant, but functional
- Scoring system with an Heuristic (Fancy words, I like that)
- Machine Learning algorithm (Wow, that's overkill)

I went with the 2nd option and I created an heuristic based on the surface and the price. 

## Improvements

This is a basic script and there is a lot of room for improvements : 

- First, Unit-testing : how to know if the code I wrote work ? Unit-testing. This is the best solution
- Metrics : It would be nice to see how great (or bad) the script works. I cheked the firsts results manually, but metrics are important 
- Heuristic improvement : Taking into account if my distance is great or bad (a customer paying less for greater space will be happy. The inverse would be bad)

# The end 🎊

Thank you for your time ! I enjoyed working on this small tests. 

I look forward to talking with you !

Vincent DEBANDE.
